        Hi there! My name is @JusTyping123 on most platforms. I am a student interested
        in maths, computer science, economics and physics. This website is for accessing my
        projects and giving information, so that you can contact me if need be.
    </p>
    <p>

        I have many projects spanning many aspects of my favourite topics. There is a programmer's
        toolkit to use when coding. There is an ML model to try and predict the closing price of
        stock indexes. There are also some more fun or experimental projects, such as the physics simulator
        to simulate forces like gravity or friction.

    </p>
    <p>

        I know how to use Python and Golang, as well as Linux and the Linux terminal. I can write simple
        Java and C# code and I am currently learning C and Rust. I can do some tasks in C++, JavaScript, HTML+CSS and
        Dart.
